## Mission
The **Ozark Cybersecurity Research Group (OCRG)** is dedicated to understanding and mitigating cyber threats through pioneering research in advanced detection and security techniques. We leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to develop novel approaches for robust threat detection—addressing challenges such as cover‑source mismatch in steganalysis and enhancing cybersecurity through self‑supervised learning frameworks. In parallel with our research initiatives, we actively contribute to the open source community by releasing innovative tools and frameworks, collaborating on projects, and sharing resources that empower organizations to strengthen their security measures.

## Current Research Focus
- **Advanced Steganalysis:**  
  Developing robust self‑supervised contrastive learning methods to detect hidden threats in digital media, ensuring invariance to diverse cover sources.
- **Threat Detection & Cybersecurity:**  
  Creating adaptive machine learning algorithms for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating emerging cyber threats across varied domains.
- **AI-Based Cybersecurity Tools:**  
  Designing and deploying end‑to‑end AI frameworks that operate in real time to counteract advanced persistent threats and obfuscate potential attack vectors.

## Research Roadmap
- **Short-Term Goals:**  
  - Finalize the development and pretraining of our self‑supervised steganalysis framework.  
  - Execute extensive hyperparameter tuning and ablation studies (e.g., evaluating temperature *τ*, momentum *m*, and loss balance *λ*) to optimize performance.
- **Medium-Term Goals:**  
  - Integrate our robust steganalysis methods with real‑time threat detection systems and validate them on heterogeneous datasets.
  - Initiate collaborative pilot projects with industry and academic partners to test and refine our approaches in operational environments.
- **Long-Term Vision:**  
  - Expand our portfolio of AI‑based cybersecurity tools to cover a broad spectrum of cyber threats, from steganography to advanced intrusion methods.
  - Continuously evolve our research agenda by incorporating new techniques, theoretical advances, and ethical guidelines to stay ahead of emerging threats.

*Additional research directions will be announced as our team expands and new partnerships develop.*
