# Ozark Cybersecurity Research Group (OCRG)

## Mission
The **Ozark Cybersecurity Research Group (OCRG)** is dedicated to advancing cybersecurity through innovative research in threat detection and security techniques. We leverage cutting-edge machine learning and AI methodologies to design robust systems for identifying hidden threats, such as steganographic content, and mitigating cyber risks. Our work will focus on creating advanced detection frameworks that are resilient to variations in data sources while being computationally efficient.

## About Us
OCRG is in its project initialization phase and we are laying the technical foundation and building our first projects. Our early initiatives will include developing prototype frameworks for advanced steganalysis using self-supervised contrastive learning techniques. We will actively share our progress and collaborate via our GitHub pages and Discord community.

- **GitHub Pages:** [ocrg.github.io](https://ocrg.github.io/)
- **Discord Community:** [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/6SDUxJzSdr)

## Our Focus Areas
- **Advanced Steganalysis:**  
  Research into self-supervised contrastive learning approaches for detecting hidden data in digital media, focusing on invariance across diverse cover sources.
- **Threat Detection & Cybersecurity:**  
  Development of adaptive AI frameworks for real-time detection and analysis of emerging cyber threats.
- **Open Source Collaboration:**  
  We believe in the power of community and open collaboration - sharing tools, frameworks, and research findings that empower organizations and researchers worldwide.

## Get Involved
We welcome collaborations from cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and students who are passionate about pushing the boundaries of threat detection. If you are interested in our projects or wish to contribute, please reach out via our Discord or contact us directly.
