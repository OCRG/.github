# Ozark Cybersecurity Research Group (OCRG)

## Our Mission
Ozark Cybersecurity Research Group (OCRG) is an emerging non-profit initiative committed to enhancing digital security and community safety through practical research, the development of targeted open-source solutions, and fostering collaborative innovation.

## About Us
Currently in its foundational stage, OCRG is laying the groundwork to address specific, often underserved, cybersecurity and safety challenges. We operate under core values of **Impact, Integrity, Collaboration, Openness, and Pragmatism**. As we progress towards formal incorporation, our focus is on applying advanced techniques in AI, machine learning, and data analysis to create tangible benefits.

- **Project Status:** Pre-incorporation, initial research and development underway.
- **Website:** [ocrg.github.io](https://ocrg.github.io/)
- **Discord Community:** [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/6SDUxJzSdr)

## Current Project Focus Areas

Our initial efforts concentrate on three key areas where we see a distinct need for improved solutions:

1.  **Advanced Steganalysis & Covert Channel Research:**
    *   Developing and evaluating novel methods for detecting hidden information concealed within digital media (steganography).
    *   Our research prioritizes robustness against modern generative techniques and diverse transmission channels, aiming to push the boundaries of reliable detection.

2.  **Healthcare Cybersecurity Enhancement:**
    *   Addressing the unique cybersecurity vulnerabilities faced by healthcare providers, particularly smaller clinics with limited resources.
    *   We are developing practical resources and potentially training methodologies focused on improving the security posture and data protection practices within these critical environments.

3.  **Public Safety Compliance Technology:**
    *   Creating efficient open-source tools designed to assist public safety personnel with location-based compliance verification.
    *   This includes developing technology to streamline processes related to ensuring adherence to regulations such as child safety zone restrictions, aiming for improved accuracy and usability over existing methods.

## Open Source Philosophy
OCRG is dedicated to open-source principles. We plan to release our tools and frameworks under permissive licenses, encouraging community contribution, transparency, and widespread adoption to maximize positive impact.
