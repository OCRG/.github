## Mission
The Ozark Cybersecurity Research Group is dedicated to understanding and mitigating cyber threats through pioneering research in steganography and steganalysis. We focus on developing novel techniques for secure communication and detection of hidden information across digital media.

## Current Research Focus
We're currently advancing the field of steganography and steganalysis through innovative approaches that combine machine learning, adversarial techniques, and robust detection methods. Our work prioritizes the development of techniques that remain effective across heterogeneous cover-sources and novel embedding methods.

## Research Roadmap (Q1-Q3 2025)
Our research roadmap prioritizes five key projects by impact and implementability:

1. **Robust Steganalysis via Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning** - Developing framework to overcome cover-source mismatch
2. **Universal Steganalysis via Adversarial Domain Adaptation** - Creating detection models resilient to variations in cover-sources
3. **Zero-Shot Steganalysis Using Transferable Representations** - Enabling detection of novel steganographic methods
4. **Diffusion-Based Steganography for Low-Detectability Embedding** - Implementing advanced embedding using diffusion models
5. **Hybrid Cryptography-Steganography Integration** - Enhancing security through multi-layer protection

## Get Involved
We welcome collaborations with researchers, cybersecurity professionals, and students interested in advancing the field of information hiding and detection. Reach out to learn more about our current projects or to discuss potential partnerships.
