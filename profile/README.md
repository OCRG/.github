# Ozark Cybersecurity Research Group (OCRG)

## Our Mission
Ozark Cybersecurity Research Group (OCRG) is an emerging non-profit initiative committed to enhancing digital security and community safety through practical research, the development of targeted open-source solutions, and fostering collaborative innovation.

## About Us
Currently in its foundational stage, OCRG is laying the groundwork to address specific, often underserved, cybersecurity and safety challenges. We operate under core values of **Impact, Integrity, Collaboration, Openness, and Pragmatism**. 
// As we progress towards formal incorporation, our focus is on applying advanced techniques in AI, machine learning, and data analysis to create tangible benefits.

## Current Project Focus Areas

Our initial efforts concentrate on two key areas where we see a distinct need for improved solutions:

1. **Healthcare Cyber Awareness Project (HCAP):**
   - A comprehensive initiative addressing cybersecurity threats in the healthcare sector through targeted training, risk mitigation, and consulting services.
   - Focused on reducing breach contributors, improving HIPAA understanding, and equipping underserved healthcare providers.
   - Developing HHS-informed training modules, actionable security resources, and compliance support tools.
   - Offering tiered subscription programs and consulting services to ensure accessibility for organizations of all sizes.

2. **Sex Offender Residence Network (SORNET):**
   - A Geographic Information System (GIS) based tool for preliminary screening of sex offender residence restrictions.
   - Leveraging advanced spatial analysis to assess compliance with legally mandated restricted zones.
   - Providing clear visualizations and actionable insights through an intuitive web-based interface.
   - Future enhancements planned for dynamic route analysis and lifestyle evaluation features.

## Open Source Philosophy
OCRG is dedicated to open-source principles. We plan to release our tools and frameworks under permissive licenses, encouraging community contribution, transparency, and widespread adoption to maximize positive impact.
